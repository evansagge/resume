I am a software developer with a focus on web applications development, with years of experience in various languages such as Ruby, Java, PHP and C/C++. I specialize in writing web applications, with a focus on Ruby and Rack-based frameworks. I also write code in Javascript and design clean and simple web interfaces.

I am heavily influenced with agile development practices, mostly from Scrum, REST-ful web development, test-driven development, behavior-driven development, and DCI. In software that I design and code, I strive to ensure that the desired application behavior are properly identified from a practical standpoint and at the same time focusing on delivering efficient, usable, manageable and modular software.

I also keep a repository of personal and open-source projects on my Github page: <http://github.com/evansagge>.

### Professional Experience
***
* Software Engineer at **New Relic** - Jan 2015 to Present

 I help lead the business enablement team to write better software for use by other parts of the company by advocating for proper code structure, abstraction, and encapsulation to ensure that the code we deliver is coherent, well-defined, and adhering to the defined acceptance criteria.
 
 I also ensure that any code that goes through are properly tested and documented as I believe not only in coding for myself, but also for the rest of the team and future teams that will come upon what we create. 
 
 I constantly push for a distributed software architecture in introducing new services into our small cluster of services to deliver the most efficient solution to our business needs.

* Software Engineer at **Quad Learning** - Mar 2013 to Jan 2015

 As part of a small software development team in Quad Learning, our main purpose was to support the American Honors program by developing software solutions relevant to each department within the small startup company. I worked to maintain and improve the original incarnation of the American Honors online learning and collaboration web application. 

 I was also instrumental in redesigning this application and setting up the architecture to turn it into a distributed and service-oriented cluster of web APIs, each with a defined purpose, and consumed through Javascript-based web applications.

 As part of the small development team that founded Infinite.ly, I spearheaded the development of the the web applications used in this service using Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Redis, Resque, Elasticsearch. I also designed the interfaces that were used to connect with external web APIs such as Facebook Graph, Twitter, Google Data, and Flickr APIs to obtain social media data. In addition, I managed the server infrastructure on AWS instances using Nginx, Unicorn, Bluepill, Monit and Newrelic.

* Software Engineer at **Exist Global** - Oct 2007 to Jan 2010

 Consulting for client companies that work with Exist Global, I implemented and maintained web and mobile applications, most of which are developed using Ruby on Rails. I also developed new features and enhanced existing functionalities for the TotSpot social networking web site using Facebook’s OpenStream API and Twitter’s OAuth API. Another company also required me to develop a web-based photo-management application using Ruby on Rails 2.3 and Facebook REST API. I also helped develop an the underlying code to render photos as cartoonized images for an iPhone application that we delivered for another client.

 I developed and maintained new and existing software solutions using a mix of C++, Java (J2SE and J2EE) and Ruby coding languages

* Part-Time Instructor at **Ateneo de Manila University** - Jun 2005 to Nov 2005
  
 I taught college classes for "Introduction to Computing: C/C++ Programming" and "Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms" as a part-time job for my alma mater in between the hours that I worked for Blue Chip Designs.
