I am a software developer with a focus on web applications development, with years of experience in various languages such as Ruby, Java, PHP and C/C++. I specialize in writing web applications, using mostly Ruby on Rails and Rack-based frameworks. I also write code in Javascript and design clean and simple web interfaces.

I am heavily influenced with agile development practices, mostly from Scrum, REST-ful web development, test-driven development, behavior-driven development, and DCI. In software that I design and code, I strive to ensure that the desired application behavior are properly identified from a practical standpoint and at the same time focusing on delivering efficient, usable, manageable and modular software.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, running, biking, and traveling to new places.

I also keep a repository of personal and open-source projects on my Github page: <http://github.com/evansagge>.

  I was also instrumental in redesigning this application and turning it into a distributed and service-oriented cluster of web APIs, each with a defined purpose (e.g. a login service API that serves as the single sign-on service; a primary API that serves as the central repository for American Honors data; an API for streams of messages and posts; an API for scheduling online meetings between advisors and students, virtual course sessions, and online seminars; an API that serves information about students relevant to advisors; etc).
