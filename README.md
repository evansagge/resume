I am a software developer with a focus on web application development, with years of experience in various languages such as Ruby, Java, PHP and C/C++. I specialize in writing web applications, using mostly Ruby on Rails and Rack-based frameworks. I also write code in Javascript/Coffeescript and designing clean and simple HTML5/CSS3-compliant web UIs.

I am heavily influenced with agile development practices, mostly from Scrum, REST-ful web development, test-driven development, and later on behavior-driven development, ensuring that the desired software behavior are properly identified from a practical standpoint and at the same time focusing on delivering simple, efficient, and usable software.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, running, biking, and traveling to new places.
